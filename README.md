# Begginer - Projects
In this repository, I have put in projects I've made within my first 3 months of programming! (Began October 2020)
In this repository you'll find many weird projects that have nothing to do with each other and the only thing
they share in common is the fact that I made them for the sake of recording my learning progress.
You'll also see a strange mixture of different Frameworks and libraries, this is only because I'm still trying to get a feel for what working in the field is like.
Enjoy these projects and if you have any questions regarding them please feel free to let me know!
